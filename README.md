# Emsh Language

Emsh language is pseudocode language (inspired by js and python syntax) that allows to generate valid code in actual programming languages. It's main goal is to speed up development by giving concise syntax that will be translated to language specific code.

Emsh allows not only to write in syntax resembling programming languages, but also in syntax that imitates spoken language by enabling usage of words instead of symbols ("=" can be replaced with "equals" and so on)

Emsh tries to allow focusing on solving problem and leaving writing efficient code to human when the solution is found and base code is generated. Modular design of translators should allow for some language specific optimizations, but that's about it.
